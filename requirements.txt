# PortMaster Development Requirements
# Test dependencies for unittest (Python standard library)

# Note: unittest is part of Python's standard library and doesn't need to be installed.
# However, we include dependencies that may be useful for testing:

# Code coverage for tests
coverage>=7.0.0

# Mock objects for testing
# (unittest.mock is part of stdlib, but this provides backports for older Python versions if needed)

# For testing with temporary files and directories
# (tempfile is part of stdlib)

# For assertions and test utilities
# (already in unittest)

# Development dependencies
loguru>=0.7.0  # For logging (used in main codebase)
